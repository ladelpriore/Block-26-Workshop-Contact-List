# Block 26 React useEffect, Workshop: Contact List
Leverage React props and useEffect to build an application that allows us to view a list of contacts and click on a selected contact to gain more details about them. 

# Requirements
While the concept may not seem that hard, this time, the data is coming from an external API. To get it, use the browser's built-in fetch() API to make an HTTP request. The API we will consume in the workshop is linked here: JSONPlaceholder. It is a free and open API that is easy to use for projects. We will make requests to the /users endpoint. 

There are five tabs below. Complete them to finish the workshop. 

I  Initialize the App 
I  Setting up the Table
I  Fetching Data and useEffect
I  Selected Contact View

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
